# Predictive-modeling
The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts a probability that a given customer will default on a loan A customer profile consists of a list of bank transactions preceding the loan request. Each transaction is either a debit (money going out of account, negative values) or credit (money coming into account, positive values).

## Customer profile (attributes) (1500 customers total): 
**Id** – id of each customer

**dates** – dates of each transaction

**transaction_amount** – numpy array of credits and debits, length varies across different customers (your predictions will be primarily based on information in this array) 

**days_before_request** – days before loan request for each transaction 

**loan_amount** – amount loaned to customer by bank

**loan_date** – date of loan

outcome:

**isDefault** – did the customer pay back (isDefault=0) or not pay back (isDefault=1)?
isDefault is given for the first 10000 customers. The goal is to assign a probability to isDefault for the remaining 5000 customers. 

Train your model on the training data (instances 0 - 9999) and make predictions on the test data (instances 10000- 14,999). The test data is the same format as training data, except it does not contain the isDefault column.

The data is available at the following link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oPSNCYeCVGJsTX60X-PW088R8S0AMmeT/view?usp=sharing

The data can be loaded from dataset.pkl in python using:
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_pickle('path/to/data/dataset.pkl')

## Submission: 
A) Your submission should be a CSV file containing 5,000 rows corresponding to instances 10000-14999 from the dataset. Each row has two columns:

column 1 – id of customer, 

column 2 – probability that isDefault==1 (probability the customer does not pay back the loan)

B) Create a small (1 page) presentation that you would hypothetically give to a salesperson of the company when presenting your algorithm, so that the salesperson could understand your algorithm and explain how it works to a potential customer.

In the 1 page, answer the following:
- Which algorithm did you use and why?
- How certain are you of the results?
- Is there a subset of potential customers that are very safe to lend to? A subset that is very dangerous? 
- What features of the dataset best predict isDefault?
- Do these features make sense intuitively? Justify your use of the features.
